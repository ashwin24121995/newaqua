                        <p>Virtual coins are the currency used to play games on AQUASTRUCT Casino. They have absolutely no real-world value and cannot be exchanged for money, prizes, or anything else of value. Think of them as "play money" or "fun tokens" that exist solely for entertainment.</p>
                        <p>Every player automatically starts with 10,000 virtual coins. You use these coins to place bets in our games. If you win, you gain more coins. If you lose, your balance decreases. Your balance is saved in your browser so it's there when you return.</p>

                        <p>Yes! All our games use random number generation to ensure fair and unpredictable outcomes. The results are not predetermined, and every spin, deal, or roll is independent of previous results.</p>

                        <p>Each game opens in the same browser window, so you'll play one game at a time.
