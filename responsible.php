                            <p>Decide in advance how long you'll play and stick to it. Use a timer if needed. Take regular breaks every 30-60 minutes to stretch, rest your eyes, and check in with yourself.</p>

                            <p>Make sure gaming doesn't take time away from work, family, friends, exercise, hobbies, or other important activities. Gaming should be one of many activities in a well-rounded life.</p>
                            <p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> Schedule gaming time after you've completed your responsibilities for the day.</p>
